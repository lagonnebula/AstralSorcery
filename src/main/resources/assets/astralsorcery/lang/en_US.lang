research.SHRINES.name=Ancient Shrines
astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.1.text=Scattered across the world are ancient shrines built from marble by a civilization long past.<NL>Some of the most renown have been located atop high hills and mountains, while smaller ones have been dug up from under the sands in deserts.<NL>While they don't seem very special at first, it's told that many of them harbor old and sacred treasures. Unlike the legends however, only a few old chests and a stories of strange floating crystals have ever been reported within.
astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.2.text=The properties of the floating crystals are quite bizarre. They appear to emit a constant shimmering light that flickers in an eerie and enchanting way.<NL>There is little doubt that these crystals are man made. Their true age and origin is practically impossible to ascertain, but after some minimal experimentation and tinkering the crystals seem to be almost imperviously fixed in their alignment with the stars.
astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.3.text=Not even the tiniest sliver can be chipped from them, even with the most destructive methods.<NL>Something seems strange about these crystals. The light they emit seems to ebb and flow almost like water in response to certain objects. §3Maybe placing a crafting §3table nearby would yield §3interesting results?§r

research.CPAPER.name=Constellation Paper
astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.1.text=Inside ancient chests found in the scattered shrines across the land, there are occasionally some blank scrolls. Unrolling one of these scrolls will cause a name to appear on the top along with a strange drawing that vaguely resembles some of the stars seen in the night sky.<NL>After collecting a number of them, it appears that each scroll shows a different set of stars to start with, but eventually they start showing up blank.
astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.3.text=On further inspection, it seems as though they are written and enchanted in such a way as to not show charts that are already mapped or in the reader's inventory.<NL>Papers can be filed between the last few pages of your journal for easy access and organization. The file can be accessed by holding shift while opening the journal.

research.WAND.name=Resonating Wand
astralsorcery.journal.WAND.1.text=When using a crafting table near one of the strange crystals in the scattered ancient ruins, the crystal will focus a single ray of light onto the table. The light is dim, yet it has a definite effect on the malleability and density of certain materials.<NL>Because of this, various crafting recipes that are not normally possible are made quite easy. The simplest object that can be crafted is a basic wand that can be used to interact with various types of starlight manipulating devices.
astralsorcery.journal.WAND.3.text=The resonating wand also has some other... unusual properties. When it is held in either hand at night, it vibrates and emits energetic sparks of light that gather in seemingly random locations around the surface of the land. Nothing seems out of place or special on the surface though... §3Maybe there's §3something deep underground?§r

research.ORES.name=Ores
astralsorcery.journal.ORES.1.text=§7§nRock Crystal Ore:§r In the deepest reaches of the world, intense heat and pressure form incredibly rare and fragile crystals. These crystals each have their own unique properties, and they seem to take in starlight with unusual ease. Due to the fragility of rock crystals mechanical hands are not careful enough when handling these ores.
astralsorcery.journal.ORES.2.text=§1§nAquamarine Shale:§r Shaped by the continuous flow of water and starlight over fragmented rock crystal, these small and fragile gems form in the sands of riverbeds. Usually they can be found close to the surface buried in patches of sand.

research.ALTAR1.name=Luminous Crafting Table
astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.1.text=Using a regular crafting table to interact with the starlight emitted by the crystal seems to be rather inefficient. The table was able to receive only a small amount of starlight from the crystal. Not only that, but the table must be in very close proximity to the crystal in order to receive any light at all.<NL>The Luminous Crafting table solves both issues perfectly. It is able to absorb and utilize a much larger amount of starlight than the crafting table in the ruins. Also, it does not require a connection to the crystal to collect starlight at all.
astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.3.text=The Luminous crafting table is not without its drawbacks though. Firstly, it needs to be placed somewhere above the ground with an unobstructed view of the sky in order to collect starlight. Its collection process also seems to be inefficient, even on the clearest of days.<NL>Placing the table closer to the sky allows it to collect more starlight. Additionally, it collects considerably more starlight during the nighttime. The table's starlight reservoir is visible beneath its crafting grid.
astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.4.text=In order to craft with the Luminous crafting table, the table must be right clicked with a resonating wand after the items used in the recipe are placed on it. When the item is done crafting, the item will be dropped onto the altar.<NL>The rate at which it collects starlight varies heavily from position to position, ranging from almost no starlight at all to vast amounts.

research.HAND_TELESCOPE.name=Hand Telescope
astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.1.text=Despite the night sky constantly shifting all the time, certain recurring patterns and shapes show up on a regular basis. Many of these shapes bear a close resemblance to the patterns on the strange star charts found in ruins.<NL>Since the shapes of the constellations apparently bear enough significance to have been recorded on charts, being able to find such patterns easily could become very useful in the future.
astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.4.text=The hand telescope, despite being a rather rudimentary device, goes a long way toward easing the process of investigating the night sky.<NL>In order to locate and trace constellations, a clear view of the night sky is absolutely necessary. Also, constellation papers of the desired constellations need to be on hand.<NL>Once a possible pattern is found, the view angle of the telescope can be fixed by sneaking. The pattern of stars can then be traced by using left click to draw lines between them.

research.GRINDSTONE.name=Grindstone
astralsorcery.journal.GRINDSTONE.1.text=A crafting table is useful and all, but to properly manipulate certain materials, a more specialized tool is required. A grindstone with a marble grinding wheel does exactly that. It allows for fine adjustments to be made to different types of crystals, as well as giving the ability to grind certain types of materials into dust.<NL>A material or object can be placed onto it and then ground by right-clicking. Right-clicking while sneaking will remove the item.
astralsorcery.journal.GRINDSTONE.3.text=Handling rock crystals properly when trying to shape them into a more fitting form is a bit of a tedious process. Frequent inspection when doing so is highly advisable, as unattentive grinding can end up reducing one to nothing.

research.TOOLS.name=Crystal Tools
astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.1.text=After some careful testing, it becomes readily apparent that pure rock crystals are nowhere near as fragile as they appear. Tools crafted with them have much more durability than normal tools made from other materials. Specifically, they don't seem to break from normal activities. Crystal tools have the collective attributes of the crystals used to craft them, and their properties such as damage and mining speed are determined by them.
astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.2.text=Unfortunately, crystal tools are not perfect. Despite their apparent unbreakability they become dull after constant use, causing them to deal less damage, mine blocks slower, etc. It is possible to sharpen them on a grindstone to regain their lost attributes, but when ground they lose size similarly to individual rock crystals. It is not possible to increase the stats of a crystal tool above the ammounts present when it is newly crafted by grinding it more than normal.

research.ROCK_CRYSTALS.name=Rock Crystal Properties
astralsorcery.journal.ROCK_CRYSTALS.1.text=Almost every newly mined rock crystal is unique. They vary in size, purity and shape, and there seems to be no way to absolutely determine what said will be during the mining process.<NL>While changing the size and purity of rock crystals does not seem to be possible at the moment, grinding off small bits of them with a grindstone to form them into a more suitable shape seems easy enough.

research.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.name=Crystal Growth
astralsorcery.journal.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.1.text=Upon immersing single rock crystals into this strange, cold, lightweight liquid, some of it keeps clinging onto the crystal.<NL>Upon closer inspection, it almost seems like the liquid starlight solidified on the surface but it quickly starts melting off of it again. Maybe leaving it in the liquid long enough might permanently increase its size?

research.MARBLETYPES.name=Marble
astralsorcery.journal.MARBLETYPES.1.text=A clean and light-reflecting variety of marble can be found from time to time while mining through the ground. The ancient shrines are all built entirely out of it, and its reflective capabilities do seem to interact with starlight in an interesting manner. Certain kinds of shaping and refinement could render it useful in various endeavors related to starlight manipulation.

research.SOOTYMARBLE.name=Sooty Marble
astralsorcery.journal.SOOTYMARBLE.1.text=Coating the surface of marble with a very dark material such as coal will change its innate reflective properties into strong absorbative properties. Sooty marble collects sunlight and heats up during the day and radiates its heat away during the night. This new type of marble may prove to be just as useful as regular marble in the future.

research.ALTAR2.name=Starlight Crafting Altar
astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR2.1.text=The starlight capacity and focusing abilities of the luminous crafting table are admirable compared to a regular crafting table, but they can be greatly inproved apon. Engineering additional reinforcements and extensions to make the table larger are not quite enough on their own though.<NL>In order to focus enough starlight to actually make use of the extensions, a large starlight collection structure made of various types of marble is required.
astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR2.4.text=The starlight reservoir in the crafting altar is not only greater in size compared to the luminous crafting table. It has special properties that cause it to turn red if the collection structure around the table is damaged, incorrect, or incomplete.<NL>In order to upgrade your table into an altar it will need to be placed in the center of the structure with a night view of the sky with the items in it then start the process with the resonating wand.

research.WELL.name=Lightwell
astralsorcery.journal.WELL.1.text=At night, a strange water-like substance seems to collect on aquamarine gems and rock crystals. On closer examination, the liquid seems to be a condensate of pure energy derived from starlight.<NL> A carefully carved basin of marble makes the collection of this liquid quite easy. The liquid emits a bright and pure light, feels very cold and a bucket full of it weighs almost nothing.
astralsorcery.journal.WELL.3.text=In order to use the Lightwell, an aquamarine gem or rock crystal needs to be placed on top of it. Gems and crystals used to gather starlight will constantly degrade until the point of completely shattering. Once placed on the lightwell, they cannot be used for any other purpose than collecting starlight.<NL>This liquid starlight seems to have interesting interactions with rock crystals and other liquids, perhaps this warrants some experimentation.

research.ILLUM_POWDER.name=Illumination Powder
astralsorcery.journal.ILLUM_POWDER.1.text=Glowstone and aquamarine exhibit a strange reaction when brought in close proximity of each other. Tiny flame-like sparks rapidly flicker between both of them. These sparks can scatter quite far from their source before going out. Shattering aquamarine into dust and mixing it with glowstone dust creates a pile of radiant powder, illuminating the space around it. Using or throwing it might help you light up your caves a bit better.

research.SKY_RESO.name=Sky Wave Resonator
astralsorcery.journal.SKY_RESO.1.text=Looking up in the sky it seems like any star is like the other. However the light they send varies from position to position; the light of one star overlays with others causing it to either amplify in strength or just vanish entirely.<NL>Placing your altar and whatever construct you come up with in the future to potentially collect this volatile light at positions where the light is amplified, might be very important.
astralsorcery.journal.SKY_RESO.3.text=Finding such positions by just plainly observing the sky at different positions seems tedious and very time-consuming.<NL>A device that somehow helps you visualize those overlaying light waves would be most convenient. It does not replace the need for exploring to find a suitable place, but should make them much easier to spot in the night by looking along the surface while holding the device.

research.SPEC_RELAY.name=Spectral Relay
astralsorcery.journal.SPEC_RELAY.1.text=Eventhough you found a suitable place where the starlight would be greatly amplified, moving your entire base there or travel back and forth seems unreasonable. Regardless of your ideas of convenience, you still do need certain amounts of starlight to actually craft something with it.<NL>A small setup, dedicated to collect starlight for the altar, should help solve that problem. Maybe. It should at least also have a clear view of the sky and will probably achieve better results at night.
astralsorcery.journal.SPEC_RELAY.4.text=Being placed high up, close to your altar, it will collect and focus starlight if a glass lens is placed inside it. The starlight is then redirected as small sparks to the closest nearby altar.<NL>However, placing too many of those close to each other will result into one collecting the others' starlight and will most likely result in much more... §odisappointing§r results..

research.QUICK_CHARGE.name=Alignment Charge
astralsorcery.journal.QUICK_CHARGE.1.text=Being aligned with a constellation, you feel a strong, quick surge of power flowing through your body as you gaze at the sky.<NL>While you don't seem to be able to properly use that white-blue energy arcing around you, you get the sense that a tools, able to properly channel it, may reveal its full potential in very different ways.

research.ILLUMINATOR.name=Cave Illuminator
astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATOR.1.text=Recalling the illuminating effects the powder made from glowstone and aquamarine has, you came up with a device that takes advantage of these properties to a massive degree. It drastically amplifies and focuses the sparks emmited by the glowstone and aquamarine using rock crystals, shaping them into small blue colored flares than can remain lit indefinitely. These flares can pass through solid objects and repel each other, allowing them to automatically space themselves evenly as they form.
astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATOR.3.text=The Cave illuminator forms these flares in any lightless open space located beneath the device itself. The process of formation is slow, but its radius extends an impressive distance from the main device. The cave illuminator also adapts to newly formed empty spaces made by mining and building, making it indispensable to avid spelunkers and miners.<NL> The Cave Illuminator requires a visible night sky to work.

research.ATT_PLAYER.name=Attunement
astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PLAYER.1.text=Crafting things with starlight and liquid starlight might be fine and all, but it seems to neglect important parts of the starlight's spectrum. Along the mundane starlight of various individual stars, you notice the light given off by the specific constellations have a much more distinct effect on you. One seems to push you in random directions, another one makes you feel much stronger.<NL>Maybe it might be possible to filter the starlight of a specific constellation and amplify it? Or maybe just collect enough to amplify its strength?
astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PLAYER.2.text=While you are unable to properly focus the light in a reasonable size, you could just build something bigger to absorb more light and try channel the light to a central point.<NL>Something of the size of your altar structure doesn't seem to be enough to collect sufficient amounts. To cope with the bigger size, you remember that you came up with some small relays to channel the light to the appropriate places. Those might turn out to be useful here aswell.
astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PLAYER.4.text=Channeling the light around is pretty useless without a central point of focusing it. An altar that can act as a relay itself at the center of the structure will act as focal point.<NL>Now, where to place the relays? Maybe the constellation papers could be of use to find the positions best suitable for channeling the part of the starlight spectrum that you're interested in.<NL>There doesn't seem to be enough starlight during the day. Maybe at night?
astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PLAYER.6.text=Just placing the relays at the designated positions didn't seem to be enough sometimes. The constellation you want to focus starlight from should be at least visible during the night.<NL>Once everything is arranged, the central altar and the relays start glowing in a bright blue light as starlight streams through them. As you planned, the starlight gets focused in the center. It's even so strong to lift the golden ornaments from the ground. What would happen if you step into the blue light? Or throw a crystal into it first?

research.ATT_PERKS.name=Alignment Perks
astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PERKS.1.text=After bathing in the beam of focused light, you see a strange pattern appear in the sky, which doesn't really resemble the constellation as you know it. The constellation seems deformed into some... other pattern. The stars of it seem way closer. Almost close enough to reach out and grab them.<NL>Upon instinctively trying to do so, you notice a flash of light appear and you feel... §odifferent.
astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PERKS.2.text=It seems you can't reach to the other stars, but you nevertheless feel stronger than you were before. The light of that other star seems to be focused onto you and it radiates off of you.<NL>You feel like using this new strength will help you to get closer to the other stars.<NL>To keep track of that, you reserve a new section in your book dedicated to this strange pattern. You should look back at it from time to time after you used some of your newly gained powers.

research.ATT_CRYSTAL.name=Crystal Attunement
astralsorcery.journal.ATT_CRYSTAL.1.text=Just as you attune yourself to a constellation, you can also attune rock crystals to a constellation. It will react stronger to that constellation and channel its effects.<NL>You are not sure what to use it for, but a construct that amplifies the channeling effect to be strong enough to have physical effects on the world around it comes to mind. Maybe you could use its focusing properties for some other things aswell?
astralsorcery.journal.ATT_CRYSTAL.2.text=You're sure you've seen those kinds of properties somewhere already...<NL>Those floating crystals inside some of the shrines around the world, right. They seem to be very capable of collecting and focusing starlight. The crystal you created seems way inferior to them, but you're certain it's the first step in the right direction when it comes to recreating them.

research.INFUSER.name=Starlight Infuser
astralsorcery.journal.INFUSER.1.text=Liquid starlight's unique properties cause it to interact with certain solid materials in several very useful ways. Especially Aquamarine gems seem to react almost violently to liquid starlight. When immersed, they almost immediately begin to absorb the liquid, vibrating and shimmering quite energetically as they do so. The result of this reaction is a resonating gem that constantly pulses with energy.<NL>This process however is not very stable and the effect fades as soon as the gem leaves the liquid.
astralsorcery.journal.INFUSER.3.text=However, a device, specifically built to induce liquid starlight into mundane materials, should be enough to keep this effect on the Aquamarine persistent. And because you're a phenomenal architect you already designed a structure for it, which includes the liquid starlight it needs for the infusion process. The infusion process can be started the same way as the altar.<NL>The process of infusing something with liquid starlight is a very energetic one, so only one item at a time can be held by this delicate device. On the upside though, most of the time it doesn't even consume a single bucket of the liquid.

research.TREEBEACON.name=Tree Beacon
astralsorcery.journal.TREEBEACON.1.text=Remembering the properties of the resonant gem, specifically its draining effects on liquid starlight, you wonder how you could apply that for your benefit.<NL>You came up with the idea of infusing trees just before they grow with liquid starlight so the resonant gem drains bits and bits from the tree when its grown. You came up with a tree, designed to distribute that liquid into nearby saplings.
astralsorcery.journal.TREEBEACON.3.text=It also has its limits: Due to the nature of this harvesting process, the trees infused with starlight will be slowly consumed overtime.<NL>Additionally, there's only so many trees your tree-construct can support before it simply won't infuse them with liquid starlight because it doesn't have enough left.<NL>After breaking your artificial tree, all the previously infused ones turn back into normal trees.

research.CHARGED_TOOLS.name=Infused Crystal Tools
astralsorcery.journal.CHARGED_TOOLS.1.text=Having experienced the growth effect liquid starlight has on rock crystals, you assumed that you could kind of repair your tools in a similar fashion. Unfortunately, the fusion of the crystals into tools seems to remove that option.<NL>But maybe with your new invention and a §obit more§r liquid starlight you could achieve something else?
astralsorcery.journal.CHARGED_TOOLS.2.text=Indeed, after infusing the previously inert tools with §la lot§r of liquid starlight, they seem to faintly glow and reflect the sky above you.<NL>Having this liquid starlight vibrantly flowing through your tools, you feel like they could perform way above your expectations for your usual tools.<NL>However, that also comes with the possibility that the liquid might be drained at some point...

research.TOOL_WANDS.name=Active Channeling
astralsorcery.journal.TOOL_WANDS.1.text=Becoming more familiar with those strange currents of energy, the urge to use them actively instead of just letting them idle grows.<NL>However, you can't just have it shoot out of your bare hands, so creating small tool rod enhanced with the newly discovered properties of the stardust should help with that.
astralsorcery.journal.TOOL_WANDS.3.text=Pick the block you want to place or replace with by right-clicking a block of that type while sneaking. Items needed will be drawn from your inventory.<NL>Upon channeling some of this spectral energy through you, you feel a bit drained afterwards. Maybe you should keep an eye out on your alignment when using those kinds of gadgets, to avoid an overload of some sort...

research.RIT_PEDESTAL.name=Ritual Pedestal
astralsorcery.journal.RIT_PEDESTAL.1.text=Just as you suspected, the attuned crystal seems already almost strong enough to make its effects manifest in the world. To be actually useful you should put a pedestal for it with another rock crystal to help focus enough starlight.<NL>After giving it a first try, the rock crystal seems to get cracks like it did in the lightwell. To avoid that, you should add some liquid starlight aswell, to fill them like they appear.

research.TELESCOPE.name=Telescope
astralsorcery.journal.TELESCOPE.1.text=The hand telescope was all good and fine, but holding still all the time is exhausting and doesn't give you a good view. Additionally, you can only make out one constellation at a time at one night, so discovering everything those constellation papers show you would take forever.<NL>You're going to need a fixture for this. That way, you might be able to look deeper into the sky, finding stars and constellations that are even further away.
astralsorcery.journal.TELESCOPE.3.text=Discovering constellations is nearly the same as with the hand telescope. You have to have a clear view to the sky when looking through it.<NL>You can only look at a section of the sky at one time with it. But you can rotate the telescope's direction with the arrows on the left and right. Drawing outside the telescope frame or rotating the telescope erases all drawn lines.
astralsorcery.journal.TELESCOPE.4.text=These new kinds of constellations you see now seem to be significantly further away from you. Attuning yourself to them might be not possible, but it should still be enough to create crystals that focus their light.

research.ALTAR3.name=Celestial Altar
astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR3.1.text=Just as you suspected, the dust has way more interesting properties than the ingot itself. Directly looking at a pile of it, it almost feels like you can see the ground behind it through an ever shifting dark sky full of stars. Its properties to channel light are truly unique.<NL>Using that as a base, further enhancing your altar to perform even more complex creations would be most desireable.
astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR3.4.text=Sadly, your current setup won't really benefit much from the upgrade since its collective abilities are limited. A bigger structure around it fully exposed to the sky should be enough to collect and focus enough starlight for your purposes.

research.LENS.name=Crystal Lens
astralsorcery.journal.LENS.1.text=Bending starlight simply from a source to a location might not be enough... The source might be at an unfitting place or the destination you want to direct starlight to is just too far away.<NL>A brilliant, yet seemingly obvious idea strikes your mind: Redirecting and refocusing the starlight via a network of lenses might provide enough reach to direct it wherever you need.
astralsorcery.journal.LENS.3.text=Constantly shifting the light into different directions over long distances takes its toll. The further the light travels the weaker it will get.<NL>Additionally, since the crystal used to construct a lens that is capable of redirecting this volatile light makes up most of the lens, the properties it had will affect the transmission rate significantly. A very impure crystal will most likely block starlight passing through by the inclusions of dust and other material it has. But also, the bigger the used crystal is, the more lenses you are able to craft from it.
astralsorcery.journal.LENS.4.text=Bound by its physicality, a lens might accept starlight from multiple directions, however it's only able to direct the light into one direction. So wherever you bend the outgoing starlight to, the lens will rotate to direct it there. To make the starlight pass through without a problem, the lens has to have clear line of sight to its destination.

research.STARLIGHT_NETWORK.name=Focused Starlight
astralsorcery.journal.STARLIGHT_NETWORK.1.text=Having iron shimmer in a blue color is nice and all, but these focused beams of starlight are more useful than that.<NL>More specifically, since these beams are a focused form of the starlight many of your inventions need to collect by themselves from the night sky, focusing them on said machinery might supply a more steady and bigger amount than what those machines can collect on their own.

research.LENSES_EFFECTS.name=Colored Lenses
astralsorcery.journal.LENSES_EFFECTS.1.text=Starlight itself seems to have a vast spectrum of underlying effects along with the energies of the constellation that created it. Under normal circumstances, those balance each other out and form almost neutral light.<NL>Filtering this light to discard other parts of the spectrum and let only the light pass that grants a possibly desired aspect might end up being really useful.
astralsorcery.journal.LENSES_EFFECTS.2.text=By fusing mundane aquamarine gems and other materials together into a glass lens, you might be able to create such colored beams when putting the result onto your newly crafted Crystal Lenses.<NL>This is not without a price though, as an additional lens that is also discarding parts of the light itself is placed onto a lens blocks more starlight than the crystal lens alone.

research.RITUAL_LINK.name=Ritual Anchor
astralsorcery.journal.RITUAL_LINK.1.text=Focusing starlight into a ritual pedestal allowed you to manifest the attunement of the crystal into the world. Unfortunately the structure required to maintain the crytal's integrity can take up alot of space. To this end you've determined it may be possible to redirect a ritual's effect using a specially constructed linking stone placed five blocks above the ritual pedestal and then linked to a matching stone some distance away.

research.LINKTOOL.name=Linking Tool
astralsorcery.journal.LINKTOOL.1.text=Recalling the slightly pulling effects aquamarines have on liquid starlight, having multiple of those condensed into one crystal might provide enough to direct and focus the raw rays of starlight in a more organized manner.<NL>Fusing them together with a rock crystal might prove a bit tedious if you don't have sufficient starlight. Luckily your newly upgraded altar might help a bit on that end.<NL>However, holding the created crystal with your bare hands seems unreasonable.
astralsorcery.journal.LINKTOOL.3.text=The crystal wand created by this fusion of gems seems to bend starlight around it at will, persistently altering the flow of said light.<NL>To select the source of starlight you want to redirect, simply right-click the source. To direct it to a specific location, right-click the other location afterwards. To dissolve the link, right-click the destination location while sneaking. To unselect the source and stop a linking process, change your active item to another item.

research.ILLUMINATION_WAND.name=Illumination Wand
astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATION_WAND.1.text=While trying to reach for the stars further and further out for your own empowering perks, you feel that you could use this internal power of yours also to illuminate the world around you.<NL>Channeling a bit of that luminescent charge into sufficiently solid blocks or the air around you, you can reinforce those blocks to withstand almost all kinds of damage.
astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATION_WAND.3.text=Given sufficient charge, shift-right-clicking a block will try to convert it into its luminescent state or revert it back into its normal form.<NL>Right-clicking will create a small yellow flare. Applying a color to the wand by crafting it together with any sort of colored dye will allow for the created flare to keep the color of the dye on the wand.

research.SHIFT_STAR.name=Shifting Star
astralsorcery.journal.SHIFT_STAR.1.text=Blinded by your discovery and the appeal of the powers an attunement to a constellation grants, you missed out on all the possibilities the other constellations offer that you've discovered now.<NL>You quickly come up with an idea to dissipate your current powers into your surroundings, releasing all charge and the celestial connection to that constellation.<NL>Unfortunately, the catalyst used for that cracks and shatters after all energy left your body.

research.STARMETAL_ORE.name=Iron Transmutation
astralsorcery.journal.STARMETAL_ORE.1.text=You feel like these beams of light could have other uses than look pretty and have their effects on the world generally. How about focusing the light directly onto one mundane iron ore with your linking tool? As source of that focused light you might aswell use one of those floating crystals in the shrines you found. Giving that one a clear view to the sky might help too.<NL>Seems like the iron reflects it back and shimmers slightly blue... Maybe something might change over time?

research.TRANSMUTATION_ORES.name=Block Transmutation
astralsorcery.journal.TRANSMUTATION_ORES.1.text=Maybe iron ore is not the only block that reacts to those focused rays of starlight? You should try some other things as well...

research.STARMETAL_RES.name=Starmetal
astralsorcery.journal.STARMETAL_RES.1.text=Shimmering blue, ice cold and sparkling as the night sky above you; The iron ore fused with the blue effect it gave off from the very beginning and formed a shimmering metal from the plain, grey iron.
astralsorcery.journal.STARMETAL_RES.2.text=On most occasions, it seems to still behave almost like iron. Exposing an ingot of it to the night sky makes it sparkle and look almost like a mirror of it.<NL>The ingot itself however seems to be rather mundane and not reactive to anything besides looking pretty. Maybe you should grind the ingot down into its dust and see what happens?

research.PRISM.name=Crystal Prism
astralsorcery.journal.PRISM.1.text=While crystal lenses are useful and all, sometimes you just want to direct the light onto multiple locations other than just one.<NL>You conclude on having a crystal acting as prism and splitting the outgoing starlight evenly across them would be the central part. Other than that it would most likely work the same way like the crystal lens.

research.COLL_CRYSTAL.name=Collector Crystal
astralsorcery.journal.COLL_CRYSTAL.1.text=Growing more and more familiar with handling attuned crystals and learning about their properties, you think you might be able to recreate what you found in those shrines. A simple crystal alone has proven to be too weak to properly channel the same amount that you experience from those big floating crystals.<NL>Enhancing the attuned crystals you've obtained might lead to something similar like the collector crystals, however you feel like there might be more ways to enhance them in the future.

research.CEL_CRYSTAL_GROW.name=Crystal Clusters
astralsorcery.journal.CEL_CRYSTAL_GROW.1.text=The stardust looks like a way better material to mess with. Its little grains occasionally flash with light and sparkle while running like sand through your hands.<NL>Accidentally, some of it dropped onto your crystals. You could hardly get it off of them... They stick to the surface of them like a thin coating.
astralsorcery.journal.CEL_CRYSTAL_GROW.2.text=Maybe you don't want to remove the coating but rather have it somehow fuse into the crystal? Throwing them both into liquid starlight and wait for them to fuse together might be one approach to that.<NL>After waiting a while you notice that they did indeed fuse together into a cluster of small blue crystals, consuming the liquid in the process.<NL>They still seem to grow a bit. Maybe you should just leave them like that for a while until they stop growing. Focusing some additional starlight onto them might also help.

research.CEL_CRYSTALS.name=Celestial Crystals
astralsorcery.journal.CEL_CRYSTALS.1.text=After having the stardust completely fuse and tint these blue-ish crystals, they still seem to share the same properties as rock crystals, but are way bigger and more robust than their white counterparts.<NL>Studying them further, they seem to resemble the rock crystals in many parts, but excel them in almost every aspect. Using them instead of the smaller ones might be very advantageous.

research.PED_ACCEL.name=Ritual Acceleration
astralsorcery.journal.PED_ACCEL.1.text=That ritual pedestal you've set up is nice and all, but it seems a bit slow and its need to have a view to the sky in order for it to focus and disperse its constellation's starlight makes it a bit clunky for what it's supposed to do.<NL>Well, if it's only the starlight of the constellation the central focus crystal that's required to run it, you could provide that as a more focused beam of light with the crystal lenses you designed.
astralsorcery.journal.PED_ACCEL.2.text=Upon trying that, it seems the crystal experiences an immense stress, like that you've seen on the lightwell. Luckily, due to your design of the ritual pedestal, that stress gets dispersed into occasional beams of light away from the pedestal.<NL>Some of those beams show a more reliable pattern and you're sure that placing crystal lenses on those places and linking it back onto the ritual pedestal will yield an even stronger effect. Now you only have to be careful not to break your precious crystal by doing so...

research.CELESTIAL_GATEWAY.name=Celestial Gateway
astralsorcery.journal.CELESTIAL_GATEWAY.1.text=The endless stars above form intricate constellations that guide all things. For eons the world has drawn upon them for references in navigation and direction, finding the morrow by the nights stars. It seems the stars acted as a guide for the crystal makers long ago, but in a much more literal sense.<NL>By focusing illumination and embedding into starlight to surround a rock crystal a base can be built to connect distant locations, even to those in another world.
astralsorcery.journal.CELESTIAL_GATEWAY.3.text=After constructing a suitable structure to support the gateway and stepping into the center the celestial alignment of all other of these gateways across the world should become evident.<NL>When an individual focuses on a point in the direction desired they will be whisked away as pure starlight and brought to their destination. Once a gateway has linked with a destination the first time, remnant images of that place will remain for future observations.

research.ENHANCED_COLLECTOR.name=Enhanced Collector Crystal
astralsorcery.journal.ENHANCED_COLLECTOR.1.text=Infusing star metal dust with rock crystal created a superior collector crystal that is able to grow much larger and more stable than most other collectors. Still, the collection of starlight wanes greatly with the passing of the night. There may be a way to further stabilize and even out the collective properties of this new crystal by constructing a specialized platform and surrounding it in liquid starlight to continually adjust the crystals resonance. This should not only even the ebb and flow of starlight throughout the day, but strengthen it overall.

research.SPECTRAL_LENS.name=Spectral Lens
astralsorcery.journal.SPECTRAL_LENS.1.text=Starlight transmission seems to be paramount to powering all the rituals, lenses and effects emanating from the starlight source. Working under and open sky affords freedom of movement and transmission but becomes impractical in some situations where working behind closed doors or underground is more ideal. By infusing illumination powder with star metal dust and using resonating gems as a regulator it is possible to create a starlight transmission that phases through any amount of solid matter in its path at the cost of some of the light's potency.

research.DRAWING_TABLE.name=Stellar Refraction Table
astralsorcery.journal.DRAWING_TABLE.1.text=Further research into the ritual properties of the constellations has led to new design. A table can now be created that can accommodate all of the known constellations and through a series of refraction, focus that light into a central working area to imbue their power as enchantments that may potentially exceed all other known levels of enchanting.
astralsorcery.journal.DRAWING_TABLE.2.text=The table seems to be able to work with up to three different constellations at once before the overlapping luminescence begins to create too much light pollution. Additionally, the table seems to require the deep cover of night to work best, eliminating other sources of interfering light from the sky.<NL>The placement of the constellations seems to have great impact as to their dominance in the final pattern. The few overlapping points from each constellation, the stronger their presence will be in the final drawing.
astralsorcery.journal.DRAWING_TABLE.4.text=Reinforcing paper with aquamarine's ability to absorb starlight has allowed the creation specialized parchment that should be able to retain the constellation placement on the table.<NL>A specialized type of glass that is able to hold the enchanting properties of the constellation will be required. Building on the altered nature of colored lenses and further joining star metal and resonating gems a glass can be made that is both strong enough and receptive enough to transfer the starlight enchantments.
astralsorcery.journal.DRAWING_TABLE.6.text=By placing the paper and infused glass on the table and directing the placement of the constellations on the paper, a new interconnected master constellation is created on the page.<NL>Too much light interference as dawn or dusk approaches increased the chance the parchment will be unable to handle such raw energy and burn. Once all three constellations have been placed onto the paper without burning the pattern will become etched into infused glass.
astralsorcery.journal.DRAWING_TABLE.7.text=The final enchantment step involves directing the new pattern of constellations onto something usable. A book should certainly be able to retain the enchantments as would most armors and weapons as appropriate to what is granted by the constellations.
astralsorcery.journal.DRAWING_TABLE.8.text=Lastly it should also be possible to bottle these enchantments. By placing a water bottle, mundane, thick or awkward potion into the table the starlight can coalesce into pure stardew.<NL>It seems likely that creating potions and books in this manner has a chance of damaging the glass, enchanting directly is almost guaranteed to damage it as well.
